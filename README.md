#Q1. To find the Distinct object in an Array in java.
A={0,1,2,3,4,0,2,1,4}
Output: 5                                         
#Q2.If input is a step number then output would be input1-true, else input1-false. 
Ex. input= 67898 
     output=67898-true  												
Explanaiton :67898 is a STEP NUMBER, because the difference between the consecutive digits is either 1 or -1 i.e difference 
between (6 and 7)(7 and 8)(8 and 9)and (9 and 8) is either 1 or -1. Hence the output would be 67898-true.
